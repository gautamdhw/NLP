Among the drunken pygmies of the so-called EU tasked with responding to the challenges and misfortunes of Trumpism, the Estonian Kaja Kallas stands out for her foresight and balance—or so they say. As the “High Representative of Foreign Policy” (just imagine what the low ones might be like), she recently unleashed three pearls of wisdom that showcase pure genius, no less.

“We don’t need one single army but 27 armies to defend ourselves, preferably with allies, but if necessary, alone.” (The fact that there are already 27 armies, costing far more than a unified one, doesn’t seem to trouble her much.)
“Spend more to prevent war, but also to prepare for it.” (A bit like breaking wind to prevent a bad smell while preparing for the worst.) War with Russia, of course—a country supposedly eager to invade Europe, even though it wouldn’t know what to do with it. Russia has always denied such intentions, has only managed to occupy a fifth of Ukraine in three years with great difficulty, and would face the entirety of NATO if it tried. It’s the largest country in the world, covering 11.4% of the Earth’s landmass, and has little need for territory. What it might need is population, as it ranks among the least populous countries with just 2% of the global population. But Kallas must have gotten wind from her cousin that Putin is desperate to invade, and no logic or military doctrine can convince her otherwise.
Let’s not forget, the world is full of erratic politicians. Kallas’ grandmother and mother were deported to Siberia in 1941 after the Soviet invasion of the Baltic states. The Baltic nations, along with Poland and the American neocons ousted by Trump, dream of a decisive war with Russia to settle old scores once and for all. But was it really necessary to entrust EU foreign policy to an Estonian blinded by anti-Russian hatred? It’s akin to Japan naming as ambassador to Washington the child of someone killed in Hiroshima, while the U.S. reciprocates with the child of a Pearl Harbor victim. Couldn’t Brussels find someone more balanced, especially now that Trump’s U.S., half of Europe, and even Zelensky are leaning toward negotiations with Moscow?

“Russia is not invincible: it has achieved limited territorial gains in Ukraine at unsustainable costs, with a collapsing economy.” True, the “limited gains”—20% of Ukraine—are beyond Zelensky’s ability to recover. Meanwhile, the collapse of Russia’s GDP has resulted in growth far exceeding that of Europe, which has been devastated by its own sanctions. Kallas, however, wants to up the ante with a “sixteenth package” to deliver the final blow—this time to Europe.
Surely, parties like the PD, FdI, and FI, which supported the EU Commission, would immediately reject such reckless statements, demanding retractions or resignations, and threatening opposition otherwise. But no. The three “Ursulines” haven’t uttered a word. They’re perfectly content. Preparing for war with the world’s leading nuclear power? What’s the big deal?
